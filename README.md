## Git vs. GitHub
**Git:**
*  Takes "screenshots" of the code
    *   Does _not_ require GitHub

Git is a program that is used to take "screenshots" of a Git   
directory (or code in the staging area) permanently for the programer.  

**GitHub:**
*  Stores information in a "cloud" 
    * (_AKA: The website [c9.io](https://c9.io)_)
    * _Does_ require Git
    * This is great for storing code, instead of typing large amounts  
      of code only to lose it by accidently deleting it.

Github is a program that actually does save the code in a "cloud" for the programer ([Cloud9](https://c9.io)
being one of many "clouds"). This is great for someone who has tons of code, yet they want to make sure that  
they never have to worry about losing said code.
