<a id="git-vs-github" class="anchor" href="#git-vs-github" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Git vs. GitHub</h2>

<p>Y'know why Git and Github are great? Because you could get a glass of<br>
milk, someone could break your computer with a hammer in hopes of ruining<br>
your hopes and dreams while your not looking, and then you can be like<br>
"Sike, I saved my code."</p>

<p>What I'm saying is, Git and Github are important for saving code. You'll<br>
get it once you read this entire tutorial/guide.</p>

<p><strong>Git:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li> Takes "screenshots" of the code

<ul>
<li>  Does <em>not</em> require GitHub</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Git is a program that is used to take "screenshots" of a Git<br>
directory (or code in the staging area) permanently for the programer.<br>
In other words, you like photography? Good, that's what it's like.</p>

<p><strong>GitHub:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li> Stores information in a "cloud" 

<ul>
<li>(<em>ex.: The website <a href="https://c9.io">c9.io</a></em>)</li>
<li>
<em>Does</em> indeed require Git</li>
<li>This is great for storing code, instead of typing large amounts<br>
of code only to lose it by accidently deleting it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Github is a program that actually does save the code in a "cloud" for the programer (<a href="https://c9.io">Cloud9</a>
being one of many "clouds"). This is great for someone who has tons of code, yet they want to make sure that<br>
they never have to worry about losing said code. Horray for being effiencent!</p>

<a id="initial-setup" class="anchor" href="#initial-setup" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Initial Setup</h2>

<p>For the initial setup, it's a very easy<br>
setup. First make a workspace:</p>

<p><code>mkdir workspace</code></p>

<p>(Tip: Make sure to use <code>git init</code> to initialize the<br>
code for version control.)</p>

<p>Then you want to make a new folder within the folder,<br>
type:</p>

<p><code>mkdir yourfilenamehere</code></p>

<p>This will make a new folder in your workspace area. You<br>
may make as many folders as you please. This is faster,<br>
yet more complex way of making files. After you are done<br>
making the folders you want type a file in your folder<br>
(<strong>NOTE: "cd" INTO THE FOLDER YOU WANT BEFORE MAKING A NEW<br>
FILE!!!</strong>):</p>

<p><code>touch filename.md</code></p>

<p>You may type into the the file as much stuff as possible. Then you<br>
want to use <code>git add .</code> to commit the file. After all is said and done,<br>
you may finally start putting the code into the repository...</p>

<h2>
<a id="repository-setup" class="anchor" href="#repository-setup" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Repository Setup</h2>

<p>The Repository Setup is used to actually save the code<br>
in a cloud to prevent typing an entire page of code<br>
again. Almost all coders use GitHub to save their<br>
progress on a project.</p>

<p>To do this, first the person needs to make a "new repository"<br>
in their GitHub account. This is where the code will be saved.  </p>

<p>Next, there will be a url in the green button that says "Clone or<br>
Download." Click on the button and copy the url in the code. There<br>
will be two things to type:  </p>

<p><code>git add remote origin URL</code></p>

<p>(Tip: Make sure to use <code>git add .</code>)</p>

<p>After that, you want to push in the code,<br>
which you will use:</p>

<p><code>git push</code></p>

<p>After that, the code will be saved on a cloud. The coder can keep editing the files in the<br>
code, and can keep using <code>git push</code> to keep saving the changes. Furthermore, this is helpful<br>
if the person's computer breaks, burn, etc. This is how GitHub can and continues to be<br>
helpful.</p>

<h2>
<a id="workflow--commands" class="anchor" href="#workflow--commands" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Workflow &amp; Commands</h2>

<p><strong><code>git status</code>:</strong> shows the progress of<br>
your code</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>!!!VERY IMPORTANT!!!</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><code>git init</code>:</strong>
initializes git in directory for version control</p>

<p><strong><code>git add .</code>:</strong> Adds files to the current directory</p>

<p><strong><code>rm -rf .git</code>:</strong> removes initalized code</p>

<p><strong><code>cd</code>:</strong> moves you to a folder</p>

<p><strong><code>cd ..</code>:</strong> moves you up a folder</p>

<p><strong><code>ls</code>:</strong> shows content in a directory</p>

<p><strong><code>mkdir</code> and <code>rmdir</code>:</strong> makes and removes directories</p>

<p><strong><code>touch filename.md</code>:</strong> makes a file</p>

<p><strong>Git used to remembering these (laugh I'm hilarious).</strong> </p>

<h2>
<a id="common-errors" class="anchor" href="#common-errors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Common Errors</h2>

<p>There are many errors you can make while<br>
coding, and that's perfectly fine as long<br>
as you, the coder, are learning from your<br>
mistakes. Many examples include:</p>

<p><strong>Git Log:</strong> Probably one of the most common error a<br>
coder has to go through, the solution here is<br>
simple! All you have to to is exit by pressing <code>q</code>.<br>
Yeah!</p>

<p><strong>Forgetting to use <code>cd</code>:</strong> In this situation, you<br>
could be making a file, but you wonder why the file is<br>
outside of the intented folder. You forgot to <code>cd</code><br>
into the folder before they made a new <code>touch</code> file.</p>

<p><strong>Misspellings and Mistakes:</strong> So your coding your file, and<br>
your ready to save, only to find that your not in your workspace<br>
anymore. What happened? Well, it could've been that you accidently<br>
typed <code>stauts</code> instead of <code>status</code>, or you forgot to put a quotation<br>
mark at the end of your commit message. Don't panic though, you can always<br>
simply <code>cd</code> back into the directory and carfully type that code again.</p>

<p><strong>COMMIT, COMMIT, COMMIT!:</strong> Your save your code with <code>git push</code>, and<br>
you expect to see the fruits of your labor on GitHub. However, you<br>
end up seeing that nothing changed! Now now, don't freak out, the world<br>
isn't ending anytime soon. You just forgot to make a <strong>commit</strong> message to your<br>
save. That's normal. Even I forget sometimes.</p>

<p><strong>Add:</strong> <em>Nooo...I'm not typing this because <strong>I</strong> forgot to do this...</em><br>
<em>T-totally not!</em> I'm just saying, if you ever plan to make a commit message<br>
to your code, make sure it's initalized with <code>git add .</code> first. Just a bit<br>
of advice...</p>
